Hi! I am Sachintha and I am a PhD Student at the [Martin Luther University Halle-Witternberg](https://www.uni-halle.de/) (MLU), at the [Chair of Econometrics and Empirical Economics](https://oekonometrie.wiwi.uni-halle.de/).
I am also a [Joachim Herz Stiftung Fellow](https://www.joachim-herz-stiftung.de/en/research/promotion-of-young-talents/add-on-fellowships-for-interdisciplinary-economics) since 2024.

My research is focused on measuring the efficacy of climate policies, both in terms of environmental effectiveness and well-being. I am also interested in research related to improving governance, accountability and socio-economic living conditions in Sri Lanka, where I am from.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as an Economist at [Verité Research](https://www.veriteresearch.org/), an independent think tank based in Sri Lanka,
where I also served as the Team Leader of the Economics unit. At Verité, I engaged in a variety of projects addressing issues such as youth unemployment, female labor force participation,
social welfare policies, and agricultural policy. I collaborated with organizations including UNICEF, UNDP, the World Bank, 
the European Union, CIPE and the Sri Lankan Government.
