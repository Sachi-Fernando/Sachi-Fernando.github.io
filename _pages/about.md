Hi! I am Sachintha and I am a PhD Student at the [Martin Luther University Halle-Witternberg](https://www.uni-halle.de/) (MLU), at the [Chair of Econometrics and Empirical Economics](https://oekonometrie.wiwi.uni-halle.de/).

My research is focused on measuring the efficacy of climate policies, both in terms of environmental effectiveness and well-being. I am also interested in research related to improving governance, accountability and socio-economic living conditions in Sri Lanka, where I am from.

Before starting my PhD I worked as an Analyst and Team Leader at [Verité Research](https://www.veriteresearch.org/), an independent think tank based in Sri Lanka. At Verité, I worked on a range of projects dealing with youth unemployment, female labour force participation, social and welfare policy, and agricultural policy.
