**Zero fare, cleaner air? The causal effect of Luxembourg's free public transportation policy on carbon emissions.** *(under review)* \
with Tobias Eibinger (Graz) [working paper link](/files/ZeroFare_Paper.pdf)

<summary> Abstract</summary>

In March 2020, Luxembourg became the first country in the world to offer free transport across all modes of public transport. We leverage this unique quasi-experimental setting to evaluate whether Luxembourg's free public transport policy led to a reduction in carbon emissions from road transport. We use spatial data from the European Emission Database on Global Atmospheric Research to construct a panel of carbon emissions for NUTS 2 regions in the EU from 2016 to 2021. Given Luxembourg's unique characteristics among these regions, Difference-in-Differences and canonical Synthetic-Control methods are inadequate for finding a suitable counterfactual for Luxembourg. Instead, we employ the recently proposed Synthetic Difference-in-Differences method, which combines the advantages of both of these methods to create a synthetic comparison for Luxembourg. We estimate an average reduction in road transport emissions of 6.1% over the period 2020-2021 attributable to the policy. To ensure a causal interpretation, we consider Luxembourg's distinctive characteristics and account for the concurrent COVID-19 pandemic as well as other challenges to address potential threats to identification. In particular, we control for confounding factors such as changes in commuting and working-from-home patterns as well as low-emission engine technologies and fuel prices. Event study analyses and sensitivity checks support the robustness of our results.

**Rising waters, falling well-being: The effects of the 2013 East German flood on subjective well-being.**

<summary> Abstract</summary>
This paper employs a panel event study design to examine the causal effects of the 2013 flood disaster in East Germany on subjective well-being. We merge geo-spatial flood data with longitudinal data from the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) to identify individuals in affected municipalities. Our results show that those affected by the flood report a significant life satisfaction drop of 0.17 points on an 11-point scale, which is equivalent to a 2.5% fall from pre-flood levels, in the year after the flood. The effect is more severe in peripheral areas than in central areas, and for low-income individuals than for high-income individuals. However, the effect dissipates by 2015. Additionally, we observe a notable initial decrease in health satisfaction, followed by recovery, while financial satisfaction was largely unaffected.
